## Overview

The `naivebayes` package provides an efficient implementation of the popular Na&iuml;ve Bayes classifier in `R`. It was developed and is now maintained based on three principles: it should be efficient, user friendly and written in `Base R`. The last implies no dependencies, however, it neither denies nor interferes with being efficient as many functions from the `Base R` distribution use highly efficient routines programmed in lower level languages, such as `C` or `FORTRAN`. In fact, the `naivebayes` package utilizes only such functions for resource-intensive calculations. 

The general function `naive_bayes()` detects the class of each feature in the dataset and, depending on the user choices, assumes possibly different distribution for each feature. It currently supports following class conditional distributions: 

  - categorical distribution for discrete features
  - Poisson distribution for non-negative integers 
  - Gaussian distribution for continuous features 
  - non-parametrically estimated densities via Kernel Density Estimation for continuous features

In addition to that specialized functions are available which implement:

 - Bernoulli Naive Bayes via `bernoulli_naive_bayes()`
 - Multinomial Naive Bayes via `multinomial_naive_bayes()`
 - Poisson Naive Bayes via `poisson_naive_bayes()`
 - Gaussian Naive Bayes via `gaussian_naive_bayes()`
 - Non-Parametric Naive Bayes via `nonparametric_naive_bayes()`

They are implemented based on the linear algebra operations which makes them efficient on the dense matrices. They can also take advantage of **sparse matrices** to furthermore boost the performance. Also few helper functions are provided that are supposed to improve the user experience. The general `naive_bayes()` function is also available through the excellent `Caret` package.


## Installation

Just like many other `R` packages, `naivebayes` can be installed from the `CRAN`  repository by simply executing in the console the following line:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
install.packages("naivebayes")

# Or the the development version from GitHub:
devtools::install_github("majkamichal/naivebayes")
```
