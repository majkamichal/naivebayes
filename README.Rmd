## 1. Overview

The `naivebayes` package offers an efficient implementation of the widely used Naïve Bayes classifier in R. It adheres to three fundamental principles: `efficiency`, `user-friendliness`, and `being written in Base R`. The package is designed to be efficient by utilizing high-performance routines programmed in lower-level languages like `C` or `FORTRAN` for resource-intensive computations. Despite being written in `Base R`, it does not introduce any dependencies or hinder its efficiency. The use of `Base R` ensures compatibility and accessibility to a wide range of users.

By following these principles, the `naivebayes` package provides a reliable and efficient tool for Naïve Bayes classification tasks, ensuring that users can perform their analyses effectively and with ease.

The general function `naive_bayes()` detects the class of each feature in the dataset and, depending on the user choices, assumes possibly different distribution for each feature. It currently supports following class conditional distributions: 

  - categorical distribution for discrete features
  - Poisson distribution for non-negative integers 
  - Gaussian distribution for continuous features 
  - non-parametrically estimated densities via Kernel Density Estimation for continuous features

In addition to that specialized functions are available which implement:

 - Bernoulli Naive Bayes via `bernoulli_naive_bayes()`
 - Multinomial Naive Bayes via `multinomial_naive_bayes()`
 - Poisson Naive Bayes via `poisson_naive_bayes()`
 - Gaussian Naive Bayes via `gaussian_naive_bayes()`
 - Non-Parametric Naive Bayes via `nonparametric_naive_bayes()`

They are implemented based on the linear algebra operations which makes them efficient on the dense matrices. They can also take advantage of sparse matrices to furthermore boost the performance. Also few helper functions are provided that are supposed to improve the user experience. The general `naive_bayes()` function is also available through the excellent `Caret` package.


## 2. Installation

The `naivebayes` package can be installed from the `CRAN` repository by simply executing in the console the following line:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
install.packages("naivebayes")

# Or the the development version from GitHub:
devtools::install_github("majkamichal/naivebayes")
```

## 3. Usage

The `naivebayes` package provides a user friendly implementation of the Na&iuml;ve Bayes algorithm via formula interlace and classical combination of the matrix/data.frame containing the features and a vector with the class labels. All functions can recognize missing values, give an informative warning and more importantly - they know how to handle them. In following the basic usage of the main function  `naive_bayes()` is demonstrated. Examples with the specialized Naive Bayes classifiers can be found in the extended documentation: https://majkamichal.github.io/naivebayes/  


### 3.1 Example data

```{r data, cache=TRUE}
library(naivebayes)

# Simulate example data
n <- 100
set.seed(1)
data <- data.frame(class = sample(c("classA", "classB"), n, TRUE),
                   bern = sample(LETTERS[1:2], n, TRUE),
                   cat  = sample(letters[1:3], n, TRUE),
                   logical = sample(c(TRUE,FALSE), n, TRUE),
                   norm = rnorm(n),
                   count = rpois(n, lambda = c(5,15)))
train <- data[1:95, ]
test <- data[96:100, -1]
```

### 3.2 Formula interface

```{r formula_interface, cache=TRUE}
nb <- naive_bayes(class ~ ., train)
summary(nb)

# Classification
predict(nb, test, type = "class")
nb %class% test

# Posterior probabilities
predict(nb, test, type = "prob")
nb %prob% test

# Helper functions
tables(nb, 1)
get_cond_dist(nb)

# Note: all "numeric" (integer, double) variables are modelled
#       with Gaussian distribution by default.
```

### 3.3 Matrix/data.frame and class vector

```{r generalusage, cache=TRUE}
X <- train[-1]
class <- train$class
nb2 <- naive_bayes(x = X, y = class)
nb2 %prob% test
```



### 3.4 Non-parametric estimation for continuous features

Kernel density estimation can be used to estimate class conditional densities of continuous features. It has to be explicitly requested via the parameter `usekernel=TRUE` otherwise Gaussian distribution will be assumed. The estimation is performed with the built in `R` function `density()`. By default, Gaussian smoothing kernel and Silverman's rule of thumb as bandwidth selector are used:

```{r kde, cache=TRUE}
nb_kde <- naive_bayes(class ~ ., train, usekernel = TRUE)
summary(nb_kde)
get_cond_dist(nb_kde)
nb_kde %prob% test

# Class conditional densities
plot(nb_kde, "norm", arg.num = list(legend.cex = 0.9), prob = "conditional")

# Marginal densities
plot(nb_kde, "norm", arg.num = list(legend.cex = 0.9), prob = "marginal")
```


#### 3.4.1 Changing kernel

In general, there are 7 different smoothing kernels available:

- `gaussian` 
- `epanechnikov`
- `rectangular`
- `triangular`
- `biweight`
- `cosine`
- `optcosine`

and they can be specified in `naive_bayes()` via parameter additional parameter `kernel`. Gaussian kernel is the default smoothing kernel. Please see `density()` and `bw.nrd()` for further details.

```{r kde_kernel, cache=TRUE}
# Change Gaussian kernel to biweight kernel
nb_kde_biweight <- naive_bayes(class ~ ., train, usekernel = TRUE,
                               kernel = "biweight")
nb_kde_biweight %prob% test
plot(nb_kde_biweight, "norm", arg.num = list(legend.cex = 0.9), prob = "conditional")
```


#### 3.4.2 Changing bandwidth selector

The `density()` function offers 5 different bandwidth selectors, which can be specified via `bw` parameter:

- `nrd0` (Silverman's rule-of-thumb)
- `nrd` (variation of the rule-of-thumb)
- `ucv` (unbiased cross-validation)
- `bcv` (biased cross-validation)
- `SJ` (Sheather & Jones method)


```{r kde_bw, cache=TRUE}
nb_kde_SJ <- naive_bayes(class ~ ., train, usekernel = TRUE,
                               bw = "SJ")
nb_kde_SJ %prob% test
plot(nb_kde_SJ, "norm", arg.num = list(legend.cex = 0.9), prob = "conditional")
```

#### 3.4.3 Adjusting bandwidth

The parameter `adjust` allows to rescale the estimated bandwidth and thus introduces more flexibility to the estimation process. For values below 1 (no rescaling; default setting) the density becomes "wigglier" and for values above 1 the density tends to be "smoother":


```{r kde_adjust, cache=TRUE}
nb_kde_adjust <- naive_bayes(class ~ ., train, usekernel = TRUE,
                         adjust = 0.5)
nb_kde_adjust %prob% test
plot(nb_kde_adjust, "norm", arg.num = list(legend.cex = 0.9), prob = "conditional")
```


### 3.5 Model non-negative integers with Poisson distribution

Class conditional distributions of non-negative integer predictors can be modelled with Poisson distribution. This can be achieved by setting `usepoisson=TRUE` in the `naive_bayes()` function and by making sure that the variables representing counts in the dataset are of class `integer`.

```{r poisson, cache=TRUE}
is.integer(train$count)
nb_pois <- naive_bayes(class ~ ., train, usepoisson = TRUE)
summary(nb_pois)
get_cond_dist(nb_pois)

nb_pois %prob% test

# Class conditional distributions
plot(nb_pois, "count", prob = "conditional")

# Marginal distributions
plot(nb_pois, "count", prob = "marginal")
```
